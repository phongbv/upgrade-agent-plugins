# Changelog

All notable changes to the upgrade-agent plugin are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [1.1.485] - 2026-09-03

### Added

- New PowerShell 5.1 to 7 upgrade scenario, backed by eight new skills covering compatibility scanning, analyzer-finding triage, Windows-only modules, removed snap-ins, WMI to CIM, Exchange Management Shell, event log to `Get-WinEvent`, and mechanical fixups.
- New `migrating-owin-authentication-handler-to-core` skill for porting custom OWIN authentication handlers to ASP.NET Core.
- The agent now captures a build baseline before assessment, so pre-existing build failures are no longer attributed to the upgrade.
- The PowerShell 5.1 to 7 scenario is now listed on the VS Code Marketplace listing.

### Changed

- Updated the embedded skills: shell-neutral command snippets and clearer NETSDK1045 guidance, a refreshed .NET version upgrade scenario, updates to the OWIN cookie, OAuth-to-JWT, and OpenID Connect migration skills, refreshed PowerShell SDK and MVC guidance, and clearer project build and SDK-style conversion steps.
- The Upgrade Dashboard now renders from a single React root, and its primary tab strip implements the full ARIA tabs pattern.
- Batched review and the solution sweep now run outside the per-task loop.
- Worker command execution is now bounded, and the orchestrator no longer re-waits indefinitely.
- The PostToolUse hook now matches only read tools.
- Updated the bundled TypeScript extender to 0.1.11 and the GitHub Copilot SDK to 1.0.11.

### Removed

- The `show_scenario_links` MCP App.

### Fixed

- Internal LLM calls now work in the GitHub Copilot App, so task start, scenario discovery, and skill ranking behave correctly there.
- Package-backed DLL references are now detected when the reference path is supplied through an MSBuild property indirection.
- packages.config to PackageReference conversion now preserves package consumption semantics.
- Task progress now counts every row in `tasks.md`, not just leaf rows.
- The Overview's task-breakdown note no longer reappears once a run has finished.
- The plugin PostToolUse hook no longer fires against a relative path outside the CLI.

## [1.1.441] - 2026-08-20

### Added

- New `managing-shared-database-schema` skill governing a SQL database that a legacy .NET Framework app and a new .NET app read and write at the same time during a side-by-side migration, covering schema ownership, expand-then-contract evolution, dual-write and backfill ordering, deployment ordering, and rollback.
- Cross-app cookie authentication upgrade option for side-by-side ASP.NET MVC migrations, offering both a shared-cookie and a remote-authentication path.
- The YARP proxy scaffold now wires up either auth-interop path, including Azure Data Protection key-ring packages, hardened proxy settings, and generated setup guidance.
- Cutover and teardown guidance for completing an EF6 Code First to EF Core migration.
- The VS Code extension now checks TypeScript extender prerequisites and reports what is missing.

### Changed

- Refreshed the .NET version upgrade scenario's planning rules, task breakdown hints, and post-completion guidance.
- Updated the data migration skills (EDMX to Code First, EF DbContext, EF6 Code First to EF Core) and the C# nullable-references skill.

### Fixed

- Hovered rows in the Live activity view are now readable under the host theme.
- Build failure state is now decided by a single predicate, so it is consistent everywhere the dashboard reports it.

## [1.1.404] - 2026-08-17

### Added

- Update .NET 11 breaking-change API compatibility.
- New Katana shared-cookie interoperability guidance for ASP.NET MVC migrations.
- Upgrade Dashboard now opens automatically in Copilot CLI and VS Code with a live overview, activity timeline, builds, Git details, rendered plan/task markdown, and durations.

### Changed

- The agent workflow now uses dedicated workers for scenario discovery, task breakdown, branch sync, and task reconciliation.
- YARP proxy scaffolding now enables forwarded headers, TLS-aware settings, and request limits by default.

### Fixed

- Canvas dashboard over-rendering, repeated filesystem rescans, ignored app theme, scenario metadata parsing, and journal ordering.
- MVC/Razor modernization missing application-relative views, splitting Razor tokens incorrectly, or misclassifying controllers in dependency graphs.
- Project and package conversion dropping assembly identity metadata or package version pins, and corrupting source during SDK-style conversion.
- Package and target-framework assessment losing package insights, suggesting downgrades for mixed-TFM solutions, or labeling unsupported packages as Unified.
- API and code dependency analysis missing moved/generic/multi-target API changes, mishandling Visual Basic dependencies, or reporting breaking changes from inactive `#if` regions.
- Windows and test migrations emitting invalid WinForms DPI settings, WinUI ContentDialog/CsWinRT changes, or non-atomic xUnit/MTP package replacements.
- Orchestrator state and MCP tool issues with stale repo facts, numeric task IDs, and lost ProjectUpgraded telemetry.

### Removed

- System skills superseded by dedicated agents: `branch-sync`, `plan-generation`, `scenario-discovery`, `state-management`, `task-execution`, `tasks-consistency`, and `token-usage-prediction`.

## [1.1.290] - 2026-08-03

### Added

- Suppport for modernization of JS/TS projects alongside .NET.
- New ARM64 migration scenario to assess, fix, and validate .NET projects for ARM64.

### Changed

- The plugin now retries MCP server launches instead of failing permanently, bounds its initialize handshake with a time budget, and terminates the full process tree when a MCP is abandoned.

### Fixed

- Project assessment returning empty when the common root is the filesystem root.
- Scenario filtering when a solution contains WebForms projects.
- Non-numeric task IDs being silently dropped from `tasks.md`.
- Improved assessment accuracy with fixes to API graph type indexing, `[Bind]` attribute token trimming, Django trait detection, and Azure Functions upgrade risk evaluation.

### Removed

- Deprecated `sub-agent-delegation` system skill (superseded by sub-agent token optimization).
- Unsupported Azure migration documentation.

## [1.1.247] - 2026-07-22

### Changed

- Increased the Upgrade MCP server startup timeout so its tools load reliably when the server is slow to start.

### Fixed

- Fixed an inverted SDK-style project guard that caused the Azure Functions upgrade analysis rule (`AzureFunctionsUpgrade.0001`) to be skipped.
- Fixed invalid JSON in the YARP scaffold `launchSettings.json` templates.

## [1.1.222] - 2026-07-16

### Changed

- **Skills**: Shortened the bundled .NET migration skill file paths to fit the plugin's 150-character path limit, and reorganized the task-execution system skill into reference files to satisfy skill-linting limits. Skill guidance and behavior are unchanged.
