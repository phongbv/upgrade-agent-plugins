# Planning Rules — .NET Framework Migration

Rules for generating top-level tasks when any project targets .NET Framework.
These supplement the common planning rules and the chosen strategy's task template.

---

## Strategy override for .NET Framework solutions

When any project targets .NET Framework, strategy selection is constrained:

| Solution shape | → Strategy |
|---------------|-----------|
| Single project (1 project total) | All-at-Once |
| Multiple projects (2+) | Bottom-Up — **non-negotiable** |

These rules override the general decision matrix in the planning stage.
Top-Down is not applicable to .NET Framework solutions (multi-targeting
across Framework and modern .NET is too fragile for libraries).

---

## SDK-style conversion

- Generate as a **separate** task from TFM upgrade — never merge these
- Condition: assessment found non-SDK-style csproj files in projects that need
  conversion (check SDK Style indicator per project)
- SDK conversion = structural change, stays on current TFM
- TFM upgrade = API surface change, new compilation errors
- These have different failure modes and must not be conflated
- Do NOT generate if all projects are already SDK-style

> **Side-by-side web projects are EXCLUDED from SDK-style conversion.**
> When Project Approach = Side-by-side for a web project, that project keeps
> its old-style csproj throughout migration. The new Core project created during
> scaffold is already SDK-style. Count only non-web projects when writing the
> task scope (e.g., "Convert 3 projects" not "Convert all 4 projects").

## TFM upgrade (all project types)

- Generate as a **separate** task AFTER SDK-style conversion **and BEFORE any per-tier/bottom-up
  code-level task** — never fold it into a per-tier task alongside packages/code fixes. A project
  still on classic `.NETFramework` cannot reference a project already retargeted to a modern TFM,
  so if TFM changes happen inside a per-tier task, the solution is unbuildable at every tier
  boundary until the whole graph finishes, which defeats bottom-up's between-tier validation
  entirely. See [../strategies/bottom-up.md](../strategies/bottom-up.md) Plan Structure item 2a.
- This task covers ALL projects that need TFM changes — not just libraries:
  - **Libraries** that serve both old and new consumers → add multi-targeting
  - **Libraries** with no old consumers remaining → in-place TFM change
  - **Console apps / Worker services** → in-place TFM change
  - **Test projects** → TFM update to match the projects they test
  - **Other non-web projects** → in-place TFM change
- The approach per project (multi-targeting vs in-place) is determined by the
  Project Approach upgrade option and the dependency graph — not by the plan.
  The task description should say "upgrade all project TFMs" and let the
  executor determine the right approach per project at execution time.
- Processing order (dependency-based grouping) is a **breakdown concern**,
  not a planning concern. The plan has one task; breakdown creates subtasks
  by dependency tier or project group when scope inventory reveals many projects.

> **Side-by-side web projects are EXCLUDED from the TFM upgrade task.**
> They get their own scaffold/migrate tasks (see below).
> Count only non-web projects when writing the task scope.

## packages.config migration

- Projects with `packages.config` must be converted to `PackageReference`
  as part of SDK-style conversion — this is handled by the conversion tooling
- Do NOT generate a separate task for this — it's part of the SDK-style
  conversion task

## Web project approach

- Web projects on .NET Framework have specific migration approaches (side-by-side
  vs in-place) determined by the Project Approach upgrade option
- In-place web projects are included in the main upgrade task
- Side-by-side web projects get scaffold/migrate task pairs —
  see next section

## Side-by-side web project tasks

When the **Project Approach** upgrade option selects **Side-by-side** for a web
project, inject three additional tasks per web project into the plan. These
supplement whatever strategy was chosen — they slot into the plan at the
appropriate position within the strategy's task ordering.

### Task pair per web project

| Task | Name pattern | Description |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| Scaffold | `NN-scaffold-{project-short-name}` | Create new ASP.NET Core project alongside the old one, configure YARP proxy |
| Migrate | `NN-migrate-{project-short-name}` | Move all web assets incrementally (broken into subtasks at execution time) |

> Either task may be broken down further at execution time — the executor escalates a task to
> the task-breaker whenever its scope spans independent concerns, which both of these can. That
> matters for anything attached to them: skill pins in a parent description do **not** reach its
> subtasks. See "Shared database between the old and new host".

> **Old project removal** is NOT a plan task. After all migration and validation
> is complete, final validation documents removal as a post-upgrade step for the
> user to perform when they've confirmed production readiness. The agent performs
> reference cleanup (re-pointing test projects, removing multi-targeting) as part
> of the migrate task, but does not delete the old project.

### Positioning within the plan

- **Scaffold** comes after SDK-style conversion + TFM upgrade of non-web projects
- **Migrate** comes immediately after scaffold

If **multiple web projects** exist, order them so that any web project depended on
by another is scaffolded and at least partially migrated first.

### Dependency libraries

Libraries depended on by the web project are **not** given separate scaffold/migrate
tasks. They are handled as part of the migrate task for the web project that depends on
them. The task description should note which libraries are in scope so the executor and
project-type skill can handle them in the correct order within the migrate task breakdown.

### Shared database between the old and new host

The side-by-side window leaves the Framework host and the new Core host reading and
writing **the same database** while both are live.

**Detect it from Framework-side evidence only.** The new host does not exist at plan time, so
"the same connection string appears in both" is not a signal you can evaluate — it can only
ever be false. Use instead: the Framework project's `*.config` carries a connection string to
an application database that the assessment shows is not being replaced, or the project being
split is backed by a single database with no per-host split planned. Combined with Project
Approach = **Side-by-side**, that is the window.

When that holds, add `#skill:managing-shared-database-schema` to the description of
every task whose scope touches the database — **at minimum both the scaffold and the migrate
task**, plus any data-access or schema task. The pin attaches the skill to the task
deterministically; without it the skill has to win a top-3 relevance ranking against the whole
catalog and usually loses to the project-type and DbContext skills, which are correct about
*moving code* and silent about *not breaking the live schema*.

**Scaffold must carry the pin too, and it is the one that most needs it.** Scaffold is where
the connection string is copied into the new host's configuration and `AddDbContext` is
registered — the exact moment a second schema writer is created, and the moment the sibling
DbContext skill offers a startup `Database.Migrate()`.

**Pins do not propagate to subtasks, and neither task is guaranteed to stay whole.** A
subtask's `task.md` is written from the breakdown, not merged with its parent, so the parent's
`#skill:` pin does not reach the child that actually touches the database. The executor
escalates any task whose scope spans independent concerns, and both of these qualify — scaffold
covers project creation, YARP, configuration and DI; migrate is decomposed by design. So do not
rely on either one executing directly.

The load-bearing mitigation is the skill's own `## Decomposition Rules` section, which
instructs the task-breaker to restate the pin on every data-touching subtask. The pins on the
two parent tasks are what make that section reachable in the first place — the breaker only
sees it because the skill is attached to the task it is decomposing.

Do not add the pin when the new host gets its own database, or when the Framework host
is retired at cutover rather than run alongside.

### Planning constraints

- Don't enumerate controllers or features in the migrate task — subtask breakdown
  happens at execution time via the `migrating-aspnet-framework-to-core` project-type
  skill and breakdown hints
- Don't merge scaffold and migrate into one task — they have different completion
  criteria and different rollback implications
- The migrate task description should list which dependency libraries are in scope
- Reference cleanup (re-pointing test projects to new Core project, removing
  multi-targeting from libraries) is part of the migrate task's final subtasks —
  not a separate plan task

### Execution constraints (save to scenario-instructions.md)

When side-by-side tasks are generated, add these constraints to
`scenario-instructions.md`:

```markdown
### Side-by-Side Web Migration Constraints
- Scaffold task must complete and validate (builds, stub 200 response) before migrate starts
- Old Framework project remains live and deployable throughout entire migrate phase
- Migrate task will be broken into subtasks at execution time — load migrating-aspnet-framework-to-core skill
- Libraries in migrate task scope are handled in dependency order before web layer assets
- Reference cleanup (test projects, multi-targeting) is part of migrate, not a separate task
- Old project is NOT deleted by the agent — documented as post-upgrade step for user
- If both hosts share one database, schema changes are governed by managing-shared-database-schema: one toolchain owns schema deployment, changes stay additive, and the EF6 `Migrations/` folder is not deleted while the old host is live
```
