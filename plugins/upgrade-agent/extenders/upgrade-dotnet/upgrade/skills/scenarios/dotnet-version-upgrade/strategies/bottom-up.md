## 1. When to Use

**Ideal when:**
- Solution contains projects targeting .NET Framework (`net4x`, `netframework`)
- Non-SDK-style csproj files are present
- Classic ASP.NET MVC/WebAPI projects requiring side-by-side migration
- The framework gap creates genuinely different upgrade mechanics per layer
  (different project systems, hosting models, API surfaces)
- Need to validate each layer independently because upgrade operations
  differ by project type

**Not recommended when:**
- All projects already target `net6.0+` — Bottom-Up’s between-tier validation
  does not work for modern-to-modern upgrades. Upgrading a leaf library to a
  newer TFM breaks all higher-tier projects still on the old TFM.
  The solution stays broken until the entire graph is complete, eliminating
  the safety benefit. Use All-At-Once (≤15 projects) or Top-Down (larger
  solutions) instead.
- Business urgency requires specific applications upgraded first — use Top-Down

> **Why not modern-to-modern?** Bottom-Up’s core value is between-tier validation:
> after upgrading Tier 1, you verify that Tier 2+ still builds on the old framework
> before proceeding. When upgrading between modern versions (e.g., `net6.0` to a
> newer TFM), a Tier 1 library on the new TFM cannot be consumed by Tier 2 projects
> still on the old TFM — the solution is broken until all tiers are complete. This
> eliminates the incremental safety benefit. For modern-to-modern upgrades that need
> incremental buildability, use Top-Down with multi-targeting instead.

## 2. Planning Instructions

plan.md should be a lightweight task list — not a duplicate of assessment.md.

### Tier determination

Build a dependency graph and assign tiers:
- **Tier 1**: Projects with zero internal project references (leaf nodes)
- **Tier N+1**: Projects depending only on Tiers 1 through N
- Verify no circular dependencies (if found, stop and present options to user)

**Required plan.md content:**

**Strategy declaration:**
```markdown
### Selected Strategy
**Bottom-Up (Dependency-First)** — Upgrade from leaf nodes to root applications, tier by tier.
**Rationale**: [N] projects with [M]-tier dependency graph.
```

**Dependency graph visualization:**
```
Tier 3: [WebAPI] [WorkerService]
         ↓           ↓
Tier 2: [BusinessLogic] [Services]
         ↓           ↓
Tier 1: [Domain] [Utilities] [Contracts]
```

**Per-tier summary** — for each tier:
- Projects included
- Dependencies on previous tiers
- Tier completion criteria

**Don't duplicate into plan.md:** per-tier package updates, per-project breaking changes. Assessment.md already has this; task.md captures execution details.

## 3. Plan Structure

**Each tier is a milestone.** In plan.md, organize tasks by tier.

**Task naming**: Name tier tasks by their content, not their tier number. Use descriptive names like `02-foundation-libs`, `03-business-logic`, `04-web-apps` — not `02-tier1`, `03-tier2`, `04-tier3`. The tier concept is structural; the task name should tell users what gets upgraded.

### Task Template

> Items below are a checklist of what tasks to include — not a format to copy.
> Transform each applicable item into the full canonical plan.md task format with paragraphs
> and Done-when criteria.

1. **Prerequisites** (always)
   - SDK/toolchain verification, global.json compatibility

2. **SDK-style conversion** (if applicable)
   - Convert non-SDK-style projects to SDK-style format on current TFM
   - Condition: assessment found non-SDK-style csproj files
   - Never merge with TFM upgrade — always a separate task
   - **Exclude** side-by-side web projects — they stay old-style throughout migration

2a. **TFM upgrade for the whole solution, when originating from .NET Framework** — a **separate,
    solution-wide task**, immediately after task 2 and **before any per-tier task in step 3**. See
    [../planning-rules/framework-migration.md](../planning-rules/framework-migration.md) "TFM
    upgrade (all project types)" — this is not optional or foldable into step 3 here: a project
    still on classic `.NETFramework` cannot reference a project already retargeted to a modern TFM
    (`net8.0`/`net10.0`) at all, so if TFM changes happen per-tier, the solution is unbuildable at
    every intermediate tier boundary and step 3's "between-tier validation: confirm higher tiers
    still build" is impossible to satisfy — there is no such thing as "higher tiers still build on
    old framework" once any lower tier has moved to the new TFM. Retarget every remaining project
    together here; step 3 then covers packages + code fixes only, never TFM changes, for this
    scenario.

3. **Upgrade per tier** (one task per tier)
   - Upgrade all projects in the tier — **packages and code fixes**; TFM changes only if task 2a
     does not apply (i.e. the solution was already fully on a modern TFM and no project ever
     targeted classic .NET Framework)
   - Tier ordering: leaf nodes first, then projects depending on them
   - Each tier task includes build validation + test execution
   - Between-tier validation: confirm higher tiers still build (on the framework/TFM they were on
     before this tier's task started — for a .NET-Framework-origin solution that is already the
     post-2a modern TFM for everyone, not "old framework")

   *(If side-by-side web migration: scaffold + migrate tasks insert here.)*

4. **Remaining projects** (if applicable)
   - Projects not covered by tier tasks (standalone apps, test projects
     testing higher-tier projects, etc.)
   - Check assessment's full project list against tasks generated so far

5. **Final validation**
   - Full solution build, test suite, document deferred recommendations

### Adaptation Rules

- If only one tier exists (flat dependency graph), use All-at-Once instead
- Tier tasks can be broken into per-project subtasks at execution time
  if the tier has many projects or complexity warrants it
- Test projects should be in the same tier as the projects they test,
  or immediately after

During execution, any tier task can be broken into subtasks. This plan
structure defines the **planning** granularity only.

## 4. Execution Guidelines

### Strict tier ordering

Cannot start Tier N+1 until Tier N is validated. This is the core safety property of the strategy.

### Per-tier flow

1. Review tier's projects and check dependencies are stable
2. Update project files + packages for all projects in tier (single operation)
3. Restore, build, fix compilation errors
4. Run unit tests for the tier
5. Validate that higher tiers (still on old framework) still build
6. Mark tier complete, proceed to next

### Between-tier validation

After completing each tier:
- All projects in tier build successfully
- All tier tests pass
- Higher tiers still build and pass their tests, on whatever framework/TFM they were on before
  this tier's task started — for a .NET-Framework-origin solution, that means the modern TFM
  everyone already shares after task 2a, not "old framework" (see Plan Structure item 2a: a tier
  task must never be the one changing TFM in that scenario)

---

## 5. Anti-patterns

**Don't fold TFM retargeting into per-tier tasks for a .NET-Framework-origin solution** — a
project still on classic `.NETFramework` cannot reference a project already retargeted to
`net8.0`/`net10.0` at all, so "upgrade this tier's TFM, packages, and code fixes" as one per-tier
task leaves the solution unbuildable at every tier boundary until the last tier finishes, with no
between-tier validation actually possible. TFM retargeting for a Framework-origin solution is
always task 2a (see Plan Structure) — solution-wide, before any per-tier task — never inside one.

**Don't create per-project plan tasks within a tier** — a tier is the planning unit. During execution, per-project subtasks are fine if complexity warrants it.

**Don't skip between-tier validation** — the whole point of bottom-up is that each tier is a stable foundation.

**Don't ignore test dependencies** — tests for Tier 1 projects should be in Tier 1 or immediately after. Don't defer all tests to the end.

**Watch for phantom dependencies** — projects that appear independent but share state via files, config, or databases.

**Multi-project tiers** — projects in the same tier can typically be upgraded in parallel within one task. If ordering within a tier exists, document it.
