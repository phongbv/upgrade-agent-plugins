# Upgrade Workflow Runtime Validation

Validate that the project still works across an upgrade by replaying a project-specific eval plan via `typescript_validate_runtime`. The plan can compile or build, run tests, start executable entry points, probe endpoints, and exercise browser flows. This workflow covers every project type (webapp, server, CLI, Electron, library, framework, plugin).

> **Runtime validation is mandatory** on every workflow: call `typescript_validate_runtime` once in Phase 1 (baseline) and once in Phase 3 (post-upgrade) — same plan, two endpoints. The baseline is enforced by the tool layer: `typescript_upgrade_package_dependency_group` does no work until it has run (error `runtime_baseline_missing`), and returns the call to make first.

## Eval plan basics

A plan looks like this (the full schema is in [plan-schema.md](./plan-schema.md)):

```jsonc
{
  "projectType": "webapp",
  "setup":   [ { "command": "npm", "args": ["ci"] } ],
  "assertions": [
    { "name": "tsc-builds", "kind": "process",
      "command": "npx", "args": ["tsc", "--noEmit"],
      "verificationMethod": "exit-code", "expected": "0" }
  ]
}
```

Three assertion kinds: `process` (spawn a command, check exit code or stdout), `http-probe` (start a server, GET URLs), `playwright-route` (replay a saved Playwright script).

For plans with `playwright-route` assertions, declare the dev server once at the top level via `devServer` — the runner starts it before assertions and kills it (process tree) after. You do not need to start or stop a dev server yourself for validation.

This teardown covers only the server the runner itself started. If you started a separate dev server to record the flows (see [recording.md](./recording.md) Step 1), that server is *not* part of the eval plan — you must stop it yourself once recording is done ([recording.md](./recording.md) Step 5). Never leave a recording dev server running into or past validation: it collides with the eval-plan server on the same URL and lingers as an orphan process after the workflow ends.

## When there is no plan

The tool returns instructions telling you to author one. Follow [plan-authoring.md](./plan-authoring.md) immediately; do not ask the user whether to proceed. After the plan is saved, re-call `typescript_validate_runtime`.

## Baseline (Phase 1)

Call `typescript_validate_runtime` with `packageDirectory`, `mode: "upgrade"`, and the caller's `sessionId`. The tool:
1. Loads the plan (or returns guidance to author one).
2. Runs `setup[]`, then runs each assertion.
3. Persists the result to `.tsupgrader/runtime-validation/baseline-result.json`.

Do not pass `resetBaseline` on the first call — it's only for discarding an existing baseline.

**A red baseline is not automatically a problem — diagnose *why* before reacting.** Two cases:
- **Plan defect** (the assertion is wrong, not the project): a `tests-pass` assertion using the wrong runner/flags, an `http-probe` whose URL the dev server doesn't actually serve or that fires during dev-server warmup, too short a timeout. **Fix the plan** so the baseline is green — otherwise the comparison is meaningless.
- **Genuine pre-existing failure** (the project itself is broken before any upgrade — it doesn't build, or its tests already fail): don't upgrade on top of a broken baseline. Stop and report via `typescript_write_upgrade_summary`, recommending the user fix the failing build/tests first; regression signal measured against an already-broken baseline is unreliable. Never fabricate a fix to force it green.

**Capture this baseline before any package is upgraded.** The baseline is the *pre-upgrade* state — if you've already bumped a version or run an install for the upgrade, the baseline is contaminated and every "pre-existing failure" it records is suspect. Run it on every workflow (it's not optional), and run it before Phase 2, not after. If you realize you upgraded first, reset to the pre-upgrade state and re-baseline; if you can't, say so in the summary rather than presenting a post-upgrade run as the baseline.

## Post-upgrade (Phase 3)

Call `typescript_validate_runtime` with `packageDirectory`, `mode: "upgrade"`, and the caller's `sessionId`. The tool reruns the same plan and compares per-assertion:

- **Regression** (was-pass → now-fail) — surfaced for you to triage and fix.
- **Pre-existing failure** (was-fail → still-fail) — ignored.
- **Improvement** (was-fail → now-pass) — informational.

The response includes baseline and post-upgrade output samples side by side.

## Plan-hash mismatch

If the plan on disk has been edited between baseline and post-upgrade, the tool aborts and tells you to pass `resetBaseline: true` to start over. Do not edit the plan mid-upgrade.

## Retry loop

On regressions:
1. Fix the application code (correlate failures against the packages you just upgraded).
2. Call `typescript_compile_package` to verify your fix compiles.
3. Call `typescript_validate_runtime` again with `retryCount` incremented.
4. Iterate up to 3 times. If still failing, revert the upgrade.

The plan is not regenerated between retries — replay determinism is the point.

Return control to the calling upgrade skill after validation passes or the retry loop is exhausted. The calling skill owns upgrade rollback and the final workflow summary.
