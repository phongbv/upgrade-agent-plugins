# upgrade-agent-dashboard canvas extension

Canvas extension that mirrors the .NET Upgrade dashboard
(`src/dashboard/`) inside the GitHub App side panel.

## Shipping

This extension is bundled into the shipped `upgrade-agent` Copilot CLI plugin
by the plugin generator (`utils/generate-plugin`), under
`extensions/upgrade-agent-dashboard/`. The generator bundles the canvas
**by default**, so the published `copilot-cli-plugin` artifact carries the canvas; pass
`--skip-canvas-extension` to opt out. `tools/install-local.ps1`
bundles the same allowlisted subset into the local orchestrator plugin by
default (`-SkipCanvasExtension` opts out).

Once shipped, the CLI runtime discovers it as
`plugin:upgrade-agent:upgrade-agent-dashboard` and loads it for **every**
Copilot App user. It was gated behind the host's `EXTENSIONS` feature flag until
2026-08-05, when github-app [#10702](https://github.com/github/github-app/pull/10702)
("Ungate project Canvas extensions") replaced the experiment check with an
unconditional `request_extensions = Some(true)`; the surviving `agent_extensions`
experiment now only controls the Extensions tab in Customize. Treat the audience
as everyone, not an opt-in subset. The generator ships an allowlisted
subset (generated `dist/extension.mjs`, flattened to root `extension.mjs`, plus
`README.md` and `canvas/app/`) and a sanitized
`package.json`; `test/`, `bin/`, `node_modules`, `install-local.*`, and
authored HTML/TypeScript are excluded. Vite builds the browser surface and
esbuild bundles `extension.ts` to `dist/extension.mjs`. The host injects `@github/copilot-sdk`
at runtime, so no `node_modules` ships.

## Prerequisites

You'll need the following installed before running or installing this extension:

- **The GitHub Copilot App (desktop)** — this extension surfaces as a *canvas*
  in the side panel of the GitHub App, which is the surface it is built and
  tested against. It does not load in VS or VS Code. It **may** load in the
  standalone Copilot CLI: that host gained canvas support in
  copilot-agent-runtime [#12532](https://github.com/github/copilot-agent-runtime/pull/12532)
  (2026-07-14), which renders URL-based extension canvases in a native webview
  window — exactly the shape `open()` returns here. Whether a given CLI build
  ships that optional webview module varies, and we neither document nor test
  that surface, so treat it as unsupported-but-possible rather than blocked.
  Nothing breaks either way: the session-dependent actions (`switch_mode`,
  `push_context`, `open_markdown_editor`) already guard for a missing host API.
  Make sure you're on a build that supports the canvas extension API.
- **Node.js 20 or newer** — the extension uses TypeScript, React, and ES modules. `node --test`
  is used for unit tests, so 20+ is required. Verify with `node --version`.
- **npm 10 or newer** — ships with Node 20. Used to install peer dependencies
  and run the test scripts. Verify with `npm --version`.
- **`@github/copilot-sdk`** — declared as a **peer** dependency. The host
  Copilot app provides this at runtime when the extension is loaded as a
  canvas. Use `npm ci --omit=peer` when building or testing locally.
- **PowerShell 5.1+ or `cmd.exe`** — for running `install-local.ps1` /
  `install-local.cmd`. The cmd variant exists specifically so you don't
  need PowerShell.
- **Microsoft Edge** (only if you'll run E2E tests) — the Playwright suite runs
  against the Edge already installed on the machine (`channel: "msedge"`), so
  there is no browser to download. Set `PLAYWRIGHT_EXECUTABLE_PATH` to override
  it with a specific Chromium or Edge build.
- **A repo with `.github/upgrades/scenarios/...` artifacts** — the dashboard
  is read-only; it surfaces files produced by the .NET upgrade agent. To
  see anything meaningful, point it at a repo that has already run through
  (or is in the middle of) an upgrade session. An empty repo will
  render a "no active scenario" empty state.

Two different things in this README are called "standalone", so they are named
apart throughout: **the standalone Copilot CLI** is GitHub's own CLI host (the
bullet above), while **standalone dashboard mode** is our `upgrade-agent-dashboard`
binary described here.

The `upgrade-agent-dashboard` command only needs Node + a
target repo — the GitHub Copilot App is not required for that mode. Its source
is `bin/upgrade-agent-dashboard.ts`; `npm run build` emits the executable
`dist/upgrade-agent-dashboard.mjs`.

## What it shows

A tabbed view of the same artifacts the Blazor dashboard reads. The bullets
below follow the tab order in the UI, which is `TAB_PANELS` in `lib/panels.ts`:
**Overview**, **Assessment**, **Plan**, **Execution**, **Activity**, and then
**Options** — authored past the `.tabs` spacer so it right-aligns as an
icon-only gear (#684), because it configures the run rather than reporting on
it.

- **Overview** — the landing tab, and the fallback for an unrecognized
  `?panel=`. A "watch it go" surface: a hero band (what is being upgraded,
  overall progress, run state, phase, elapsed/remaining time, latest build
  result), the task in flight and its steps, one at-a-glance row per headline
  number, the newest journal events, and a repository rollup. Its cards include
  contextual handoffs into the corresponding detail tabs; the whitelist of
  destinations is `OVERVIEW_LINK_PANELS` in
  `canvas/src/overview/panels.ts`.
- **Assessment** — the merged assessment view. Built from
  `<scenario>/assessment.json` and `<scenario>/dependencies-health.json`, it
  shows a summary header (metric tiles, severity donut, category bars) plus
  data-gated sub-tabs:
  - **Summary** — top categories / high-level counts.
  - **Issues** — the per-project incident table, grouped and filterable.
  - **Projects** — the assessment-derived project table (`*.csproj`/`*.fsproj`
    discovered the same way as
    `Dashboard.Core.Providers.Build.ProjectDiscovery`, with target frameworks
    read from the XML).
  - **Dependencies** — packages + per-project compatibility from
    `dependencies-health.json`; each package row expands to the projects that
    use it (capped, with "Show all N").
  - **Features** — detected feature usage.
- **Plan** — the scenario's `plan.md` plus every `tasks/<id>/task.md`, rendered
  as markdown. Each document offers an "Open in editor" button that opens the
  file in the built-in `editor` canvas.
- **Execution** — what the agent is actually doing, in three sub-views
  (`EXECUTION_VIEWS` in `canvas/src/Execution.tsx`):
  **Tasks** (parsed `<scenario>/tasks.md` — emoji-prefixed lines in
  `TasksProducer`'s format — with progress, overview, and a hierarchical
  state-badged list whose rows expand to their `progress-details.md`),
  **Builds** (the `build_completed` activity events, with per-project results),
  and **Repository** (the repo-shaped view of what the run has changed: the
  working branch and the source branch it came from (read from
  `scenario-instructions.md` when present, otherwise derived from
  `branch_changed` journal events), plus files-changed / insertions / deletions
  / commits totals derived by `lib/repo-summary.ts` from the journal rather
  than by shelling out to git. A newest-first list of commit activity rows
  shows their recorded file, insertion, and deletion counts and expands, via
  `/api/commit-files` and `/api/commit-diff`, to each commit's files and then
  to each file's diff).
  `?panel=tasks`, `?panel=builds` and
  `?panel=repository` deep-link straight to a sub-view.
- **Activity** — tail of `<repo>/.git/upgrade/activity.jsonl` (falls back to
  `.vs/upgrade/activity.jsonl`), formatted per `JournalEventTypes`. Sub-views:
  **Log** (chronological), **Timeline** (SVG lanes per event category, with
  close-together events batched into one marker), **Commits**, and **By File**.
  `system` events (settings/provider lifecycle) remain visible in the Log with
  muted styling and are repeated in Diagnostics when that debug panel is open.
- **Options** — the gear. Renders the active scenario's
  `scenario-instructions.md` as option cards, with a Flow Mode toggle that
  relays `switch_mode` to the agent (shown only when the current mode is
  `guided` or `automatic`, so an unrecognized value is never silently
  overwritten). Shows an empty-state hint when there is no active scenario, or
  when the scenario folder has no `scenario-instructions.md`.

Tabs that no longer exist, and where their `?panel=` names went: **Projects**
(#507) and **Dependencies** (#506) were folded into Assessment (#509/#508) and
now resolve only as the `assessment:projects` / `assessment:dependencies`
sub-tab deep links; **Tasks** was folded into Execution (#512/#513) and `tasks`
survives as an Execution sub-view; **Scenario** was removed outright (#668) and
`scenario` is not a valid panel in any form. `lib/panels.ts` is the authority
for all of this.

### Diagnostics (debug only, hidden by default)

Path probes, repo-root resolution source, and env-var echoes are still built
into the snapshot and rendered into an overlay, but by default **nothing in the
UI opens it** — there is no tab and no icon. It is always reachable by:

- the `set_panel` canvas action with `{ panel: "diagnostics" }` (i.e. asking
  the agent to open the diagnostics panel), or
- `?panel=diagnostics` on the URL in standalone dashboard mode
  (`upgrade-agent-dashboard --panel diagnostics`).

This keeps a support/debugging affordance available without shipping it as
part of the product surface.

Setting `UPGRADE_AGENT_DASHBOARD_DIAGNOSTICS=1` additionally offers a footer
button that opens the same overlay (#786) — useful when you are debugging the
dashboard yourself and don't want to route through the agent. Exactly `1`
enables it; every other value, including `true`, leaves it hidden. The two entry
points above work either way.

Because the canvas is hosted by the desktop app rather than launched from your
shell, the variable has to be set for the app's own process:

```cmd
setx UPGRADE_AGENT_DASHBOARD_DIAGNOSTICS 1
```

Then restart the host app — `setx` writes the user environment, and only
processes started afterwards inherit it. An already-running Explorer may not
propagate the change to newly launched apps either; sign out and back in if the
button doesn't appear.

Data is served from a loopback HTTP server on `127.0.0.1:0`. The webview pulls
state via `GET /api/state` and subscribes to `GET /events` (Server-Sent Events)
for live updates as the activity log grows.

## Frontend development

The canvas is one React application rooted at `canvas/src/main.tsx`.
`canvas/index.html` is only the static Vite entry with one `#root`; `App` owns
the shell, SSE subscription, actions, overlays, and every panel. Panels remain
mounted and toggle with `hidden`, preserving component-local state while their
snapshot caches update independently. Existing IDs and classes remain the
browser-test contract.

The global stylesheet lives in `canvas/src/dashboard.css` and is imported by
`main.tsx`. Component-specific static styles live beside their components (for
example, `Overview.tsx` imports `Overview.css`). Vite extracts both into a
hashed CSS asset during the build.

The topbar product mark is the `ProductMark` React component in
`canvas/src/overview/icons.tsx`. It renders inline SVG with
`fill="currentColor"` on the bot silhouette so it inverts with the host theme —
a hard-coded colour would vanish against either the light host theme or the
standalone dark fallback — while the arrow keeps a fixed brand gradient that
reads on both.
Keeping it inline also means it ships automatically: the plugin generator's
canvas allowlist copies `canvas/app/` wholesale, so no new asset path has to be
added to it.

```powershell
npm ci --omit=peer
npm run typecheck
npm run build
npm run test:unit
npm run test:e2e
```

`npm run build` emits `canvas/app/index.html`, hashed Vite assets under
`canvas/app/assets/`, generated `dist/extension.mjs`, and generated
`dist/upgrade-agent-dashboard.mjs`, plus individual generated helpers under
`dist/lib/`. These outputs are ignored and must be regenerated after editing
browser sources, `extension.ts`, `bin/upgrade-agent-dashboard.ts`, or `lib/*.ts`.

Tests are authored in TypeScript. Playwright runs `test/e2e/*.test.ts` directly;
the unit-test build emits Node 20-compatible `dist/test/unit/*.test.mjs` before
`node --test` executes them.

## Install (POC)

A helper script handles install/uninstall. By default it installs into
**user scope** at `$COPILOT_HOME/extensions/upgrade-agent-dashboard/` (where
`$COPILOT_HOME` defaults to `~/.copilot`), so the canvas shows up in every
session — no workspace setup required. extensionId becomes
`user:upgrade-agent-dashboard`.

```powershell
# Default: build, then install at user scope
.\install-local.ps1

# User scope, but link generated runtime files (needs Developer Mode or admin)
.\install-local.ps1 -Symlink

# Project scope instead — only available in the specified workspace
.\install-local.ps1 -Workspace C:\path\to\test-workspace

# Reuse existing canvas/app/ and dist/extension.mjs output
.\install-local.ps1 -SkipInstall

# Remove it
.\install-local.ps1 -Uninstall
.\install-local.ps1 -Workspace C:\path\to\test-workspace -Uninstall
```

The runtime discovers only a root file named `extension.mjs`; it does not use
`package.json.main`. Installers therefore flatten generated
`dist/extension.mjs` to root `extension.mjs`, which registers the canvas at
`joinSession({ canvases: [...] })`. After editing extension code in symlink
mode, run `npm run build`, then call `extensions_reload` (or restart the agent)
to pick it up.

## Canvas surface

- `extensionId`: `user:upgrade-agent-dashboard` (or `project:upgrade-agent-dashboard` for project-scope installs)
- `canvasId`: `dashboard`
- `displayName`: `Upgrade Agent Dashboard`
- Open input: optional `{ panel?: "overview" | "assessment" | "plan" | "options" | "execution" | "activity" | "assessment:summary" | "assessment:issues" | "assessment:projects" | "assessment:dependencies" | "assessment:features" | "tasks" | "builds" | "repository" | "diagnostics" }` — unknown values fall back to `overview`. The `assessment:<sub>` forms deep-link to a specific Assessment sub-tab (the old `projects` / `dependencies` panels are now sub-tabs of Assessment); a sub-tab hidden for lack of data is ignored rather than landing you on an empty section. `tasks`, `builds` and `repository` open Execution on the corresponding sub-view (`tasks` was a top-level tab until issues #512 / #513 merged it into Execution). `diagnostics` is a debug-only overlay with no UI affordance unless `UPGRADE_AGENT_DASHBOARD_DIAGNOSTICS=1` (see [Diagnostics](#diagnostics-debug-only-hidden-by-default)). The authoritative list is `lib/panels.ts`.
- Actions:
  - `refresh` — force-reload artifact state from disk.
  - `set_panel` — agent-driven tab switch (input: `{ panel: <one of the above> }`).
  - `switch_mode` — relay a request to switch flow mode (input: `{ mode: "guided" | "automatic" }`); posted as a chat message to the host agent.
  - `explain_dependency` — relay a request to explain a dependency / version drift (input: `{ packageName: string }`).
  - `open_markdown_editor` — open a markdown artifact in the built-in `editor` canvas (input: `{ path: string }`). The extension calls `session.rpc.canvas.open` directly, so this costs no agent turn; re-opening the same document focuses the existing panel. The path must be a `.md` file that resolves — symlinks followed — to a real file inside the repo root; anything else is rejected. Unavailable in standalone dashboard mode (there is no canvas host).
  - `push_context` — hand the agent a summary of what the user is currently looking at in the canvas.
  - `open_feedback_issue` — open a prefilled "send feedback" issue on `microsoft/upgrade-agent-plugins` in the user's **OS default browser** (no input). Backs the footer's "Feedback" button, which first opens an in-canvas dialog disclosing that the issue is public, which repo it lands in, and that a personal GitHub.com account is required. The dialog has no compose box: the canvas holds no GitHub token (`gitHubAuth.getStatus()` returns auth state but not a token), so the handoff to github.com is unavoidable and the report belongs in GitHub's editor, which has markdown preview, draft recovery and image paste. Prefill only pre-populates the GitHub form; nothing is submitted until the user presses Create, and the auto-filled environment table (plugin version, host, host version, scenario id, target framework, phase) deliberately excludes repo path, repo name, project names, and package names — as well as OS and Node. The destination is a hardcoded constant in `lib/feedback.ts`, never read from `plugin.json`. The built-in `browser` canvas is *not* used: it carries no GitHub session, so the new-issue URL lands on a login page. When no URL handler exists (headless hosts, containers) the action returns `{ ok: false, url }` and the canvas copies the link to the clipboard instead. Available in standalone dashboard mode — it needs no Copilot session.

## Limitations vs. the Blazor dashboard

This POC reads the same on-disk artifacts and is migrating one panel at a time
from imperative DOM rendering to React. The MCP server's `ServiceHostLifecycleService` spawns
the ServiceHost process to produce `activity.jsonl` — the canvas extension
only reads the file.

### ServiceHost lifecycle

The MCP server (`ServiceHostLifecycleService`) is responsible for spawning and
managing the ServiceHost process. The canvas extension no longer manages the
ServiceHost — it only reads the `activity.jsonl` file produced by it.

For local development, the `CopyServiceHostForLocalDev` MSBuild target in the
MCP `.csproj` copies ServiceHost build output into `$(TargetDir)Dashboard/`
after build, so `dotnet build` is sufficient (no `dotnet publish` required).

### Behaviour it mirrors

The canvas re-implements, rather than shares, a handful of Blazor dashboard
behaviours. When those change on the .NET side, the corresponding
`lib/*.ts` source and its test-only `dist/lib/*.mjs` output need the same change:

- the activity event types (`task_started`, `task_completed`,
  `task_failed`, `file_modified`, `commit_created`, `build_completed`,
  `phase_entered`, `branch_changed`, …) and their human formatting;
- `ProjectDiscovery`'s rules for finding `.csproj`/`.fsproj` and extracting
  `<TargetFramework>`/`<TargetFrameworks>`;
- the summary metrics + severity / category chart data `AssessmentProducer`
  publishes. Note the canvas reads `assessment.json` and
  `dependencies-health.json` only from the scenario folder, which is where the
  current writers put them; the Blazor readers retain extra defensive
  fallbacks (`<scenario>/assessment/`, `.vs/upgrade/assessment/`) that no
  writer targets.
